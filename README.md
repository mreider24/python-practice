# Python Practice

## Problems and Examples from Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Albert Sweigart

Trying to work on learning some python this summer (2016) and will be putting the problems here as I work through it. Hoping it will also help me get more comfortable with github.

Mainly just typing this up for myself as I don't expect anyone else to really see it.  If by any chance someone comes across it, I am mainly going to be talking myself through the exercises or comparing them to the little I know of JavaScript.  JS is really the only other language that I have some experience with, but I am not an expert at that by any means either.  The descriptions may end up sounding terrible to anyone that knows anything about either JS or Python.
