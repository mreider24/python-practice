This program is teaching the difference between local and global variables.  Defining eggs in both the spam and bacon function and as a global at the bottom.

```python
def spam():
    eggs = 'spam local'
    print(eggs)             # Prints 'spam local'

def bacon():
    eggs = 'bacon local'
    print(eggs)             # Prints 'bacon local'
    spam()
    print(eggs)             # Prints 'bacon local'

eggs = 'gloabal'
bacon()
print(eggs)                 # Prints 'gloabal'
```
