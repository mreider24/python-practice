# Chapter 03 page 64 - magic8Ball.py

Magic 8 ball program with 9 options.  It is showing how to use return, also showing a program with multiple elif statements.  I couldn't get this to actually print in the interactive shell.  I couldn't find a typo.  Will update later if I can figure out what is wrong.

```python
import random

def getAnswer(answerNumber):
    if answerNumber == 1:
        return 'It is certain'
    elif answerNumber == 2:
        return 'It is decidedly so'
    elif answerNumber == 3:
        return 'Yes'
    elif answerNumber == 4:
        return 'Reply hazy try again'
    elif answerNumber == 5:
        return 'Ask again later'
    elif answerNumber == 6:
        return 'Concentrate and ask again'
    elif answerNumber == 7:
        return 'My reply is no'
    elif answerNumber == 8:
        return 'Outlook not so good'
    elif answerNumber == 9:
        return 'Very doubtful'

    r = random.randint(1, 9)
    fortune = getAnswer(r)
    print(fortune)
```
