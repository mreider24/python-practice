This program is showing another example of global vs local.

```python
def spam():
  global eggs
  eggs = 'spam'   #mthis is the global

def bacon():
  eggs = 'bacon'  # this is the local

def ham():
  print(eggs)     # this is the global

eggs = 42         # this is the global
spam()
print(eggs)
```
