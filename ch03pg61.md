# Chapter 03 page 61 - helloFunc.py

Chapter 3 covers functions.  This is the first little program the book is doing where you create your own function.

```python
def hello():    # def defines the function
    print('Howdy!')           # These three lines are what the function does when called
    print('Howdy!!!')
    print('Hello there.')

hello()         # Calling the function three times
hello()
hello()
```
