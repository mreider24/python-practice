# Chapter 02 page 57 - printRandom.py

In this section the book is showing how to import modules.  In this case it is using random as an example and this is printing a certain number of random integers between two numbers that you set.

```python
import random  # imports the module
for i in range(5):  # number of times it will run
    print(random.randint(1, 10))  # calling random, making it an integer, and giving it a range of values.
```
